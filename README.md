# TicTacToe
A simple 2 player game with a graphical user interface using JavaFX.
A simple project i made to learn more about JavaFX, the game consists in 2 player turns.  If you liked the game, by request i can also add a player vs pc edition, but since i have little time this is what i made for now. (inserts shrug). I hope you will like it! (Or maybe not, it's still ok)

Ps. sorry for the GUI it's really terrible lol
